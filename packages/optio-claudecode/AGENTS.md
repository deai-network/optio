# optio-claudecode — Agent Cheatsheet

Run Anthropic Claude Code as an optio task — local subprocess or remote
host via SSH — with the interactive TUI exposed in the dashboard via a
ttyd-served iframe.

Full design: `docs/2026-05-28-optio-claudecode-design.md`.

## Public API

```python
from optio_claudecode import ClaudeCodeTaskConfig, create_claudecode_task

create_claudecode_task(
    process_id="my-task",
    name="My task",
    config=ClaudeCodeTaskConfig(
        consumer_instructions="...",
        credentials_json=...,        # opaque dict/bytes/str → ~/.claude/.credentials.json
        claude_config=...,           # dict → ~/.claude/settings.json
        env={"ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "..."},
        permission_mode=None,        # default | plan | acceptEdits | bypassPermissions
        allowed_tools=None,
        disallowed_tools=None,
        ssh=None,
        install_if_missing=True,
        install_ttyd_if_missing=True,
        claude_install_dir=None,     # default ~/.local/bin (per host)
        ttyd_install_dir=None,
        before_execute=None,
        after_execute=None,
        on_deliverable=None,
    ),
)
```

`TaskInstance` returned has `ui_widget="iframe"` and `supports_resume=False`
baked in.

## ClaudeCodeTaskConfig field semantics

* `credentials_json` — opaque payload; planted at
  `<workdir>/home/.claude/.credentials.json` with mode 0600. dict →
  JSON-encoded; bytes → UTF-8 decoded verbatim; str → written
  verbatim.
* `claude_config` — JSON-encoded to
  `<workdir>/home/.claude/settings.json`.
* `permission_mode` — forwarded verbatim to `claude
  --permission-mode`. Validation happens in `__post_init__`.
* HOME isolation: every task sees `HOME=<workdir>/home` so concurrent
  tasks on one host never share `~/.claude/` state.

## Hooks

`before_execute(hook_ctx)`, `after_execute(hook_ctx)`,
`on_deliverable(hook_ctx, relative_path, decoded_text)`. Identical
signatures and failure semantics to optio-opencode.

`before_execute` fires **after** AGENTS.md and HOME files are planted
and **before** ttyd launches.

`after_execute` fires after claude exits (or after cancellation), on
both success and ERROR paths.

## Log-file contract

Same as opencode. AGENTS.md tells claude to append to `./optio.log`:

- `STATUS: [N%] <msg>`
- `DELIVERABLE: <workdir-relative-or-absolute-path>` (must resolve
  under `<workdir>/deliverables/`)
- `DONE[: summary]`
- `ERROR[: message]`

DONE / ERROR terminate the session.

## Binary install

* claude — `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`. Vendor
  script places binaries under `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<v>/`
  and a symlink at `~/.local/bin/claude`. The framework always exec's
  the absolute symlink path; no PATH mutation needed.
* ttyd — downloaded from `tsl0922/ttyd` GitHub Releases (pinned
  version). Linux x86_64/aarch64/armv7l only in v1.

Override install locations via `claude_install_dir` /
`ttyd_install_dir` (absolute paths).

## Testing

```
pytest packages/optio-claudecode/tests/
```

Needs MongoDB via Docker for the integration tests.

Fake binaries (`claude-shim.sh`, `ttyd-shim.sh`, `fake_claude.py`) live
in `tests/` and substitute the real ones during integration tests. The
ttyd shim prints a fake "Listening on http://127.0.0.1:N/" banner so
the framework's port discovery completes without opening a real socket.
The claude shim resolves its own symlink (via `readlink -f`) before
locating `fake_claude.py`, since the framework symlinks the shim into
a tmpdir.

Remote SSH automated tests are deferred to a follow-up plan. See the
design doc's "Open follow-ups" section.
